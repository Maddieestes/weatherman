# weatherman
Description:
A simple weather dashboard that utilises the OpenWeather API to gather the current weather info and a five day forecast in cities.

What I learned
Taking the time to write this project really taught me a lot. I learned the wrong way to work with API's and the right way. I hope to continue to work with API's in order to feel confident while working with them.

Challenges
Istruggled to start this project and being able to have a functional final product. I decided to start with some basic HTML and figure out the API calls then the rest started to work itself out as I was recieving the data and understanding how it all worked.
